- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


I like encapsulation because in the end I don't have to write as much code. It takes a little more thinking and planning in the moment because you want to make sure everything can work together. We were given exactly how to implement everything and what methods/variables we needed. I think if I had to do it from scratch I would have struggled more, but after seeing how it was organized I think I have a better understanding of how to start a project like this. For me, the best thing was to follow the steps on the README.
